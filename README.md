## Project Description

dkj-business is a dynamic e-commerce platform that allows users to post and purchase products in an online marketplace. The platform supports two types of users: 

1. **Sellers** – Users who can post products for sale, manage their inventory, and purchase other users' products.
2. **Non-Sellers** – Users who can browse the marketplace and purchase products but cannot post items for sale.

### Key Features
- **User Registration & Authentication:** Secure login and registration system using Flask-Login.
- **Marketplace:** A central hub displaying all available products.
- **Product Management:** Sellers can add, update, and remove their products from the market.
- **User Profiles & Balance Management:** Users can view their profile details, including their balance, and update information as needed.
- **Secure Transactions:** Ensuring that purchases are processed securely.

Upon logging in, users are directed to the "Market" homepage, where all available products are displayed. Sellers can manage their inventory through the "My Products" section, while all users have access to a settings section to review personal information and balance details.

## Project Structure
The project consists of several key directories and files that handle different aspects of the platform:

### Main Directory
- **dkj_business/** (Main project package)
  - **static/** – Contains Bootstrap files and media assets (uploaded product images, user profile pictures, and project logos).
  - **templates/** – Stores HTML templates:
    - `add_product.html` – Page for sellers to add a new product.
    - `index.html` – Homepage displaying all products for sale.
    - `layout.html` – Base template extended by all other pages.
    - `login.html` – Login page for user authentication.
    - `products.html` – Displays a seller's products for sale.
    - `profil.html` – User profile page to view personal information.
    - `register.html` – Registration page for new users.
  - **forms.py** – Defines FlaskForm classes to manage all form handling.
  - **models.py** – Defines database schemas using Flask-SQLAlchemy.
  - **routes.py** – Contains route definitions that control webpage navigation and backend logic.
  - **helpers.py** – Utility functions for password validation and file type checking.
  - **run.py** – The main entry point to start the application.

### Additional Directories
- **instance/** – Contains the project's database files.
- **migrations/** – Stores database migration scripts generated by Flask-Migrate.

## Routes & Functionality
### Authentication
- `/login` – Allows users to log in.
- `/logout` – Logs the user out.
- `/register` – Handles user registration.

### Product Management
- `/` or `/home` or `/index` – Displays all products in the marketplace.
- `/dkj-business/<username>` – Displays the marketplace for a logged-in user.
- `/<username>/add_products` – Allows a seller to add a new product.
- `/myProducts` – Displays a list of products owned by the logged-in seller.

### User Profile
- `/profil` – Displays the user profile.
- `/modifyProfil` – Allows users to modify their profile details.
- `/modifyPassword` – Enables users to change their password securely.

## Design Choices
Several key design decisions were made during development:

1. **Flask-SQLAlchemy for ORM:** Simplifies database interactions and provides robust data modeling.
2. **Flask-Login for Authentication:** Enables secure user authentication and session management.
3. **Flask-WTF for Form Handling:** Provides an easy-to-use framework for handling user inputs securely.
4. **Poetry for Dependency Management:** Streamlines package installation and management.
5. **Bootstrap for Frontend Styling:** Ensures a responsive and visually appealing UI.
6. **Security Enhancements:**
   - Password validation (minimum length, uppercase, lowercase, digit, special character requirement).
   - File upload validation to restrict allowed file types.
   - Secure session management with Flask-Login.

These choices were made to keep the project modular, maintainable, and scalable for future enhancements.

## Installation and Setup
To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dkj-business.git
   cd dkj-business
   ```

2. Install dependencies using Poetry:
   ```sh
   poetry install
   ```

3. Set up the environment variables:
   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Edit the `.env` file with appropriate values.

4. Initialize the database:
   ```sh
   flask db upgrade
   ```

5. Run the application:
   ```sh
   poetry run flask run
   ```

## Future Improvements
- **JavaScript-based Popups:** Implementing modals for product addition instead of redirecting to a new page.
- **Search & Filtering:** Allowing users to search and filter products by category, price, or name.
- **Payment Gateway Integration:** Enabling real transactions for purchases.
- **Enhanced User Dashboard:** Providing statistics on user purchases and sales.

## Conclusion
The dkj-business project is a fully functional e-commerce platform designed with Flask. It provides user authentication, product management, and a secure transaction system. The project structure is designed to be modular and scalable, making it easy to expand and improve in the future.

This README provides an overview of the project, including its purpose, functionality, and technical implementation. Further improvements could include integrating payment gateways, enhancing search functionality, and improving the UI for a better user experience.
